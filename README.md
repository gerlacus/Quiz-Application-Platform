<h1>Quiz Application Platform</h1>
<p><b>Role:</b> sole developer</p>
<p><b>Tools:</b> Python 3, PyQt 5</p>
<p><b>Description:</b></p>
<p>Simple quiz application in which users complete questionnaires that determine whether they are more suited for one option or another (e.g. more suited to West coast versus East coast, more of a dog person or a cat person, whether they prefer beer or wine, etc).</p>
<p>Users can save their progress, load previously-saved progress, change questionnaires, and answer the questions in any order they prefer.</p>
<p>I created this application to familiarize myself with Qt, a framework that specializes in GUI creation, allowing users to interact with a program through the use of windows, dialogs, input fields, and various other GUI elements provided by the OS.</p>
